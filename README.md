# project_euler solutions

These are my personal solutions to the Project Euler problems at http://projecteuler.net.

My main language is C++. The source for each problem is located either in the root directory or each problem's folder.

Simple problems like 1 and 2 were quickly compiled on the command line, while the rest were made into NetBeans projects. Linux executables for such are in subfolders under <problem>/dist.
